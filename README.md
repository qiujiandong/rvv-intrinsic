# RISC-V Vector Extension Intrinsics for Clangd

## Related Issues

- [clangd#2143](https://github.com/clangd/clangd/issues/2143)
- [llvm-project#109634](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/109634)

The RISC-V vector intrinsic functions are defined in `<riscv_vector.h>` as follows:

```c
#pragma clang riscv intrinsic vector
```

While the compiler can recognize these, `clangd` currently does not. It may support them in the future, but for now, you'll need to manually generate these header files as a workaround.

## Demo

Let's write some RVV code!

## How to Use

### 1. Generate Header Files

Start by generating the intrinsic files from `rvv-intrinsic-doc`. Clone the submodule:

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The intrinsic version is v0.12.x. Prepare your Python environment, navigate to the `rvv-intrinsic-doc` directory, and then run the following commands:

```shell
cd rvv-intrinsic-generator
pip install -r requirements.txt
make
```

The intrinsic files will be generated in `rvv-intrinsic-doc/auto-generated/` in `.md` format. We need to convert these to `.h` format.

Run the script in the `scripts` directory:

```shell
./scripts/run.py
```

This will generate the header files in the `rvv_intrinsic` directory.

### 2. Configure Clangd

The `rvv_intrinsic.h` file organizes the header files with corresponding extensions. You do not need to include this file directly in your application, as the compiler already knows about these intrinsics.

However, `clangd` does not automatically recognize them. To configure `clangd`, please refer to the [Configurations](https://clangd.llvm.org/config) documentation. Add the following configuration to your `.clangd` file:

```yaml
CompileFlags:
  Add:
    [
      -include /path/to/repo/rvv_intrinsic/rvv_intrinsic.h,
      -I /path/to/repo/rvv-intrinsic/rvv_intrinsic,
    ]
```

This will force the inclusion of `rvv_intrinsic.h` and allow `clangd` to locate the generated header files.

## Testing

Before running tests, make sure you have prepared the RISC-V toolchain and `bear`. `bear` is used to generate the `compile_commands.json` compilation database, which is required by `clangd`.

- [RISC-V GNU Toolchain](https://github.com/riscv-collab/riscv-gnu-toolchain)
- [Bear](https://github.com/rizsotto/Bear)

The `tests` directory contains various RISC-V vector extension subset test cases, including:

- _zve32x
- _zve32f
- _zfh_zvfh_zve32f
- _zve64x
- _zve64f
- _zve64d

For more details on the different vector extensions, refer to the [RISC-V V-Spec v1.0](https://github.com/riscvarchive/riscv-v-spec/releases/tag/v1.0).

To generate the compilation database (`compile_commands.json`), run the following command in the directory where the `Makefile` exists:

```shell
bear -- make
```

If you have the `clangd` [plugin](https://clangd.llvm.org/installation#editor-plugins) installed in VSCode or Neovim, it should work seamlessly.
